# A Guessing Game

## Description

The Number of A Guessing Game is a Python program that offers an engaging challenge to users. It generates a random number and invites the user to guess it. The program's interactive interface prompts the user to input their guess. After each guess, the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user accurately guesses the number, at which point the program displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.

## Example

Suppose the random number to guess is 79:

```

Guess a number between 1 and 100: 80
